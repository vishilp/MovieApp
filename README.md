<h1 align="center">React-Based Movie Application</h1>
<h2>Movie App thats connected to a Movie Database and creates a favorites list</h2>
<p>This project was mainly for me to learn how React works, specifically the component-based design and React hooks like useState, useEffect, and Contexts. It features a popular movie tab and a favorites tab, as well as the ability to search for movies and add them to your favorites list. </p>
